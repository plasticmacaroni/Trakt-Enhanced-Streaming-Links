# Trakt-Enhanced-Streaming-Links
This Firefox extension adds to the default Trakt streaming links and attempts to find media on custom-defined locations.

When clicking on the play button on a Trakt media source of any kind, a popup shows sites that stream the content. This extension adds functionality to that popup and attempts to index up to three extra sites provided by the user. Kanopy, for example, is a popular library-video website not supported by Trakt and its JustWatch integration.

To add the popular library of movies on Kanopy for users that would like to utilize their library cards, you would:
1. Visit Trakt.com
2. Open the "Trakt Enhanced Streaming Links" extension now visible to the far right of the address bar by clicking on the icon
3. Add up to three sites to be indexed, e.g. "www.kanopy.com"
4. Click the play button next to any media listed on Trakt, and the extension will attempt to find the most relevant search result related to that media on that website

If there is not a play button available on Trakt Movies or TV Shows, it is because the media is not yet available on physical media or streaming services.

This extension isn't perfect, but it utilizes Google search results to hopefully find the most relevant result on any website without having to integrate with the relevant websites directly. It works 100% perfectly, 80% of the time.
